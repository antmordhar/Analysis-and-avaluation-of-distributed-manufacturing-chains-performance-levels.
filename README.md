### Part II: Analysis and evaluation of distributed manufacturing chains performance levels.
The main subject is focused on ERPs and the exploitation of data in a company. It will explain how to treat the data since it arrives from the factory until it is finally use as the company's efficiency indicators. The main objectives that EbroFoods needed to meet is that we get used to use SAP -ERP that the company is working with- and
some of its modules. In addition, a comparison will be made between different reporting tools and we will use one of them to make a report with real factory data.

In the first place we will be studying the set of software tools that EbroFoods uses to perform a distributed work. Among these elements are SAP and its modules, a virtualization system and database. We will analyze where they are located in the company and how they relate to each other.

On the other hand, we will see how to evaluate the performance of manufacturing lines using the main standard measure for this, the OEE. This calculation will be used in a report system, which the company commissioned with this project. For this, we will proceed to the study of the internal software scheme of the company and the previously mentioned comparison. For the realization of all this we will do a planning based on SCRUM methodology.

To continue the guide created in the previous project, the entire process of creating the reporting system will be documented. We will start with the design of the reports and then -after the implementation- the consequent validation of the results.

Finally, a conclusion will be made about the results of the project and the work that could be
done in the future.
